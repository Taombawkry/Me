## **Introduction**

Attending [Devcon7 ](https://devcon.org/en/about) in Bangkok was an insightful experience filled with learnings, new connections, and exciting avenues of thought. Any gathering of so many thoughtful, interesting, and brilliant people is bound to produce something special, and this event was no exception. Combine this with the culturally vibrant backdrop of Thailand, and you have an environment bustling with energy and collaboration.

One of the recurring themes in conversations during Devcon was the question: *"Where are the apps?"*, or *"Where are the real-world solutions?"* For those unfamiliar, this question often challenges whether Ethereum hosts use cases that go beyond financial speculation, extending to real-world, protocol-level applications. This sentiment is echoed by many within the Ethereum community. The truth is, these apps and projects *do* exist. The challenge lies not in their creation or implementation but in how we communicate and distribute information about them.

Devcon7 was one of the most diverse gatherings yet, bringing together underrepresented regions like Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. These communities shared their stories, challenges, and synergies, offering a powerful reminder that impactful projects are being built and run by real people solving real problems using Ethereum as their engine.

A key takeaway from these dialogues, however, is the persistent issue of siloed efforts and communication. Despite progress in global connectivity, the continued questioning of *"Where are the apps?"* highlights gaps in how we share and showcase impact.


#### Scope of Artifact

This artifact centers on the concept of **impact**: how [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/) can be harnessed as a tool to **measure**, **enable**, and **communicate** impact effectively. While many projects within the ecosystem already address pressing human challenges, they often lack **standardized methods** to articulate their value—whether through metrics, narratives, or frameworks that capture their [social return on investment (SROI)](https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/migration/eurasia/Appendix-SROI-methodology_ENG.pdf). Without such tools, these efforts risk being undervalued or misunderstood, both within Web3 and beyond.

This artifact explores how Ethereum can act as an enabler for social impact initiatives, offering transparent, decentralized, and scalable systems for innovation. It also serves as an **invitation**—encouraging both current builders and external projects addressing human problems to **consider Ethereum’s unique strengths**. Whether it’s transparency, programmability, or interoperability, Ethereum offers tools to expand the scope and effectiveness of impact-driven projects.

Over time, Ethereum has matured into a platform capable of tackling real-world challenges, from decentralized finance to cultural preservation. This artifact delves into how we can **standardize communication**, **measure impact**, and **position projects** addressing human problems as models for global innovation. By aligning tools, narratives, and frameworks, we can amplify Ethereum’s potential as a catalyst for meaningful and sustained societal change.



## **Section 2: Understanding Impact and Its Role in Social Good Projects**

Impact is a term that is widely used but often misunderstood. At its core, it refers to the changes caused by an action, decision, or initiative. These changes can manifest as:

![9c2d1bf9-8b90-4376-996c-37bb2b6cbbb0](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJb-zddQye.png)


- **Positive or negative**, depending on the effect.
- **Intended or unintended**, as not all outcomes are planned.
- **Direct or indirect**, reflecting both immediate and ripple effects.

In Ethereum’s ecosystem, impact often emerges from decentralized applications [dApps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application) or initiatives that address real-world problems. Measuring and communicating this impact, however, remains a challenge. While **outputs** (e.g., number of workshops conducted or transactions processed) and **outcomes** (e.g., improved knowledge or behavioral shifts) are relatively straightforward to track, **impact**—the broader societal or environmental changes over time—is harder to pin down in comparison. Yet, it is the most significant measure of success for social good projects.

To gain a comprehensive picture of progress, we must move beyond *purely* [quantitative](https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/) metrics and incorporate **qualitative data**. Qualitative data, such as narratives, experiences, and feedback from stakeholders, adds depth and context to the numbers. It allows projects to:

- Understand the **why** and **how** behind changes observed.
- Identify nuances that may not be captured by numerical metrics alone.
- Provide a human perspective, which is crucial for projects aimed at addressing human challenges.

By integrating qualitative data with quantitative metrics, we can establish a clearer and more holistic view of impact. For example:

- **Quantitative Data**: A privacy education initiative reports that 500 participants attended workshops in a quarter.
- **Qualitative Data**: Feedback reveals that participants feel more confident using privacy tools, and some share stories of protecting their online identities.

The qualitative insights contextualize the numbers, demonstrating not just participation but meaningful change in attitudes and behaviors.

For Ethereum-based projects, this dual approach to data—combining numbers with narratives—aligns with the ethos of decentralization and inclusivity. Blockchain technology enables immutable, transparent record-keeping, but it is the human stories behind these records that truly showcase impact.

By acknowledging the value of both types of data, projects can craft [**theories of change**](https://www.theoryofchange.org/what-is-theory-of-change/) that are comprehensive, relatable, and actionable, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of progress and impact.

### **2.2 Defining Public Goods and Commons Goods**

The concept of [**public goods**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/public-good.asp) is central to understanding the kinds of projects that aim to solve human problems. Traditionally, public goods are defined by two key characteristics:

![TypesOfGoods](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByGwRDO7kl.jpg)

- **Non-excludable**: Accessible to all, regardless of contribution.
- **Non-rivalrous**: Use by one person doesn’t reduce availability for others.

Examples of public goods include clean air, public parks, and free knowledge resources. In the web3 space, public goods are often associated with open-source tools, decentralized governance protocols, and community-focused innovations.

However, "public goods" has become a loaded and broad term—one that can be challenging to define and prone to misinterpretation. For instance, the term is often conflated with the public sector or government-driven initiatives, which can create unnecessary confusion when describing projects outside those contexts.

During a panel discussion I was a part of on *"Public Goods in [Global Majority Regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_majority),"* I had the privilege of exploring these challenges with some incredibly brilliant people further and was introduced to the concept of **commons** or **commons goods**.

[**Commons Goods**](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Commons) provide a more community-specific lens and offer terminology that is less likely to be conflated with government initiatives or the broader "public" sector. Commons goods refer to resources or projects that are maintained and utilized by a defined group of people, offering intrinsic value to their shared community. Examples include:

- A decentralized platform for local farmers to manage supply chains.
- A [governance token](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-governance-token) enabling a regional [Decentralized Autonomous Organization(DAO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) to oversee development initiatives.

The shift from public goods to commons goods acknowledges that impact doesn’t need to operate at a global scale to be meaningful. Localized, community-driven initiatives can have profound effects on the people they serve. 
Ethereum projects, by their very design, are uniquely positioned to foster such **commons-driven impact**, enabling collaboration and innovation at a community level.

Special thanks to [Michael Bauwens](https://x.com/mbauwens?s=11) for his detailed insights on how these terms are defined and applied.

## **2.3 Focus on Human Problems vs. Protocol Problems**

Within the Ethereum ecosystem, projects can broadly be grouped based on the types of problems they aim to address. To clarify these categories and their scopes, it's important to distinguish between **infrastructure**, **protocols**, and **applications** (dApps). Each operates within specific domains of challenges or opportunities:

1. **Infrastructure Problems**: These are challenges related to Ethereum itself as a foundational platform. They include advancements in scalability, security, energy efficiency, and decentralization.
  
  - **Example**: [Ethereum 2.0 upgrades](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/), which address scalability and energy efficiency by transitioning to [Proof of Stake](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/merge/).
  ![COMPARISON-OF-PROOF-OF-WORK-AND-PROOF-OF-STAKE](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1CfluuQJl.png)

  - **Example**: Projects enhancing Ethereum’s developer tools, like [Hardhat ](https://hardhat.org) or [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), which make building on Ethereum more efficient.
2. **Protocol Problems**: These involve decentralized protocols that operate on Ethereum and offer functionalities like governance, finance, or data storage. Protocols are often "building blocks" for dApps, addressing issues like liquidity, interoperability, or resource allocation.
  
  - **Example**: [MolochDAO](https://molochdao.com/), a protocol that focuses on funding Ethereum public goods through a collective decision-making model.
  - **Example**: [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/), a token router protocol that facilitates decentralized trading and liquidity provision.
3. **Application Problems (Human Problems)**: These involve real-world challenges that directly impact individuals, communities, and societies. Solutions aim to improve quality of life, economic conditions, or access to critical resources. They focus on practical, tangible issues like education, healthcare, poverty alleviation, and climate action.
  
  - **Example**: A dApp enabling microloans for underserved regions, providing financial access and empowerment.
  - **Example**: [AgriTech ](https://agri-tech.io/)platforms that use smart contracts to streamline supply chains and ensure fair payment for farmers.

#### **Why These Distinctions Matter**

These categories highlight the different domains of challenges Ethereum-based projects address. While **infrastructure and protocol problems** are essential for the ecosystem's functionality and growth, this artifact emphasizes **human problems**. 
The impact of these projects extends beyond the Web3 ecosystem into broader **societal contexts**. They showcase Ethereum’s potential to act as an enabling force for tangible, *positive change* in the world.

For example:

- Protocol-level innovations like [Layer 2](https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-layer-2) scaling solutions (e.g., [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/), [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/)) improve the usability and affordability of Ethereum, indirectly supporting human-focused dApps.
- Infrastructure-level advancements like modular upgrades to Ethereum (e.g., [Danksharding](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/danksharding/) ensure the protocol's capacity to serve as a backbone for projects solving human problems)

While both protocol and infrastructure developments are critical, this piece is focused on the **direct human-centric applications** of Ethereum technology. These projects deal with tangible impacts on communities, making Ethereum more accessible and *meaningful* to the broader population.

#### **Framing the Problem Domains**

Ethereum’s unique strength lies in its ability to support initiatives across all these categories. However, for human-centric projects, the focus isn’t just on solving immediate challenges but on creating systems that **scale impact** sustainably. This requires thinking holistically:

- **How** can infrastructure improvements **unlock** more use cases for human problems?
- **How** can protocols evolve to better **support** applications that prioritize social good?
- **How** do human-focused dApps integrate these advancements to create **real-world change**?
  

#### **Next Steps**

As we progress through this artifact, we’ll explore Ethereum’s capacity to address these distinct types of challenges in depth. The upcoming sections will align this focus with global frameworks and principles, aiming to establish a shared understanding of **impact**. 

If you’re familiar with my writing, you’ll know how obsessive I am about providing clear definitions—ensuring everyone is on the same page is not just a preference(most times) but a necessity for meaningful discussion.

#### **Why Build on Ethereum?**

When considering solutions to human problems, the question naturally arises: *why Ethereum?* Why build systems addressing social good, commons goods, or even protocol issues on this platform, rather than using traditional tools or other blockchain ecosystems?

Ethereum distinguishes itself as a platform for building **for the long term**. The values ingrained in its development—**credible neutrality**, **decentralization**, **open-source ethos**, and **permissionless participation**—provide the foundation for enduring systems that prioritize **resilience, inclusivity, and adaptability**. These principles set Ethereum apart, making it an ideal framework for enabling impactful innovation.

#### **Ethereum’s Core Strengths**

1. **Credible Neutrality**:  
  Ethereum operates as an impartial platform that doesn’t favor any specific group, region, or ideology. This neutrality allows projects to focus on solving real-world problems without fear of undue influence or censorship.
  
2. **Transparency and Accountability**:  
  Blockchain is inherently a **history technology**—an immutable, distributed ledger that records actions, outcomes, and interactions. This characteristic makes Ethereum particularly suited for impact-driven projects that require verifiable and transparent tracking of progress, whether for community governance, funding, or reporting.
  
3. **Programmability**:  
  Ethereum enables the creation of **smart contracts**—self-executing agreements that automate processes based on predefined conditions. This feature opens up innovative possibilities for creating **reputation-based systems**, **tokenized incentives**, and even **dynamic funding models** that evolve with a project’s needs.
  
4. **Interoperability and Composability**:  
  Ethereum’s modular ecosystem allows projects to leverage existing tools, protocols, and infrastructure without reinventing the wheel. For instance, [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835#:~:text=Decentralized%20finance%20(DeFi)%20is%20an,transact%20directly%20with%20each%20other.) tools can be integrated seamlessly into social good projects to enable microloans, staking, or revenue-sharing models.
  
5. **Permissionless Access**:  
  Ethereum provides equal access to its ecosystem for anyone with an internet connection. This accessibility is critical for enabling global collaboration and creating solutions that serve marginalized or underrepresented communities.
  

#### **Building for the Long Term**

![659b823b9e73f2ff21176a7b_3af2GPPFEu3P8kZwioSQtz-akpHa6w-KcQWeBX5eomyuf62C6C_9oEBvjUQWp5CkTUVBHWIONxeB3X1jFuITr4S7La4hl9p4-X6bJMb7PkSNoyJmQE3DvHwDCYGpBNeI05KiLBQB1YrEMh5pvEqmDl8](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SySsx__mJl.jpg)


Ethereum’s ethos is deeply rooted in **longevity**. As emphasized during Devcon7, the ecosystem prioritizes deliberate, thoughtful decisions aimed at sustainability over rapid, short-term gains. This philosophy is reflected in Ethereum’s measured transition to [Proof of Stake](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/), its modular approach to scalability through [Danksharding](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/danksharding/), and its steadfast commitment to decentralization.



Additionally, [Justin Drake](https://x.com/drakefjustin) has proposed the ambitious [Beam Chain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_qiFdUSzRg&pp=ygUXanVzdGluIGRyYWtlIGJlYW0gY2hhaW4%3D), outlining a visionary five-year upgrade plan to further enhance Ethereum’s infrastructure.

> "Ethereum is built for the long term. The values we care about—credible neutrality, open participation, decentralization—interfere with quick wins. But they create deep, strong roots that enable a long-lasting, resilient ecosystem."
> 
> — Aya Miygutchi

This commitment to building enduring systems mirrors the goals of social good projects, which often aim to create sustainable, generational change.

#### **Practical Considerations**

To determine whether Ethereum is the right fit for a given problem or project, it’s essential to evaluate its **unique properties**:

1. **Immutability**: Does your project require a permanent, tamper-proof record of actions or data?
2. **Transparency**: Would open, auditable processes enhance trust in your solution?
3. **Programmability**: Could automation through smart contracts reduce operational inefficiencies or introduce novel mechanisms for value exchange?
4. **Inclusivity**: Does the global, permissionless nature of Ethereum align with your project’s goals?

If these qualities resonate, Ethereum may provide the foundational tools to not only address challenges but amplify their solutions at scale.



## **2.5 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Social Impact Projects**

![e_2018_sdg_poster_without_un_emblem_letter_us](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SynRRwOm1l.png)

The [**Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), established by the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/), provide a universal framework for (*very generally*) addressing global challenges such as poverty, inequality, climate change, and access to education. While *ambitious* or *broad*, they offer a practical structure for organizing efforts toward measurable, impactful progress.

Projects built on Ethereum that aim to deliver social impact have the opportunity to align their efforts with the SDGs, leveraging this framework to organize and standardize their outputs. For instance:

- **Goal 1 (No Poverty)**: DeFi applications can expand access to financial services for underserved populations, enabling microloans, remittance solutions, and financial inclusion.
- **Goal 13 (Climate Action)**: Blockchain solutions can provide transparent systems for tracking carbon credits, incentivizing sustainable practices, and holding organizations accountable.
- **Goal 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions)**: Decentralized governance structures like DAOs can foster participatory decision-making, enabling communities to oversee resources or resolve disputes.

By mapping their objectives to SDG goals, social impact projects gain a common language to communicate their value, both within the Web3 ecosystem and to external stakeholders such as funders, policymakers, and community members.

#### **Navigating Skepticism Toward SDGs**

That said, I’m fully aware of the skepticism within the Web3 ecosystem toward the SDGs. Critics often point to the perception that these goals are overly broad or disconnected from practical realities, making them feel more like branding exercises than actionable benchmarks. 

However, this skepticism doesn’t negate the need for a structured way to communicate and measure impact, especially for social impact projects that depend on *public trust* and support.

For social impact projects, adopting frameworks like the SDGs doesn’t mean surrendering autonomy; rather, it ensures their efforts are **measurable, comparable, and communicable**. It also bridges the gap between the Web3 space and external institutions by providing a shared reference point for evaluating progress.

Web3 projects, particularly those leveraging Ethereum, have a unique strength in their **permissionless and participatory** design. Unlike traditional systems, where decision-making is centralized and opaque, blockchain offers a platform where stakeholders can actively engage in governance, funding allocation, and systemic improvements. This is a natural alignment with the principles of the SDGs, such as inclusivity, equality, and collaboration.

#### **Choice and the Importance of Stakeholder Involvement**

For social impact projects, the inclusion of **stakeholder voices** is paramount. Decision-making, resource allocation, and the design of solutions should reflect the needs and priorities of the communities they serve. Blockchain-based tools can enhance this by enabling transparent voting mechanisms, governance token systems, and real-time tracking of impact metrics.

A key principle here is the idea of **choice**. Social impact projects must empower individuals and communities to make informed decisions, ensuring they understand and evaluate all available options. Without this, any decision becomes prescriptive rather than participatory.

> **If a decision occurs when only one option is understood, it’s not a choice—it’s merely acquiescence.** Decisions made under such conditions often lead to unintended, long-term repercussions.

By incorporating stakeholder input and aligning their objectives with SDG principles, social impact projects can deliver meaningful outcomes. This participatory model also demonstrates how blockchain technology can act as a neutral yet powerful enabler for long-term, scalable solutions to global challenges.

### **2.6 Stages of Social Good Projects**

Every project aimed at addressing human problems goes through three general stages:

![output](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJFbCwO7ye.png)


1. **Research and Discovery**:
  
  - Identifying the problem and understanding its nuances.
  - Examples include surveying communities or analyzing existing gaps or researching tech stacks.
2. **Thesis Creation**:
  
  - Developing a solution or framework to address the problem.
  - For instance, designing a dApp to improve financial literacy in rural areas.
3. **Validation of Thesis**:
  
  - Measuring whether the solution works and produces the desired outcomes.
  - This includes collecting data, creating theories of change, and iterating based on feedback.

These stages are *iterative*, not **linear**, allowing projects to adapt as they learn from their communities and results.

#### Theories of Change in Social Impact Projects

A Theory of Change (ToC) is a comprehensive description of how and why a desired change is expected to happen in a particular context. It outlines the steps from activities to outcomes and impacts, providing a roadmap for achieving specific goals.

Developing a ToC generally involves:

- **Identifying Desired Outcomes:** Clearly defining the social or environmental changes the project aims to achieve.
  
- **Mapping Activities to Outcomes:** Linking specific actions or interventions to the anticipated short-term and long-term outcomes.
  
- **Assumptions and Risks:** Articulating the underlying assumptions and potential risks that could affect the success of the project.
  
- **Indicators of Success:** Establishing measurable indicators to assess progress and impact.
  

#### **Integrating Theories of Change with Blockchain**

In the context of Ethereum and blockchain, a ToC can leverage technology to enhance transparency, accountability, and data integrity:

- **Quantification of Qualitative Data**: Blockchain can help derive numerical values from qualitative data, such as stakeholder feedback, to ensure a balanced measurement approach.
- **Immutable Records**: Activities, outcomes, and impact data can be stored immutably on-chain, providing a transparent and verifiable history of the project’s progress.
- **Smart Contracts for Feedback Loops**: Automation through smart contracts can trigger actions (e.g., releasing funds, issuing rewards) based on predefined milestones or stakeholder inputs.

## **3. Case Studies and Areas for Impact**

Blockchain technology has matured to the point where it enables solutions that address significant human challenges in regions often underserved by traditional systems. This section explores notable Web3 projects and studies from Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, showcasing their contributions to social impact and the enhancement of daily life.

### **3.1 QuarkID: Decentralized Identity in Latin America**

[QuarkID](https://extrimian.io/wikis/quarkid-the-self-sovereign-identity-ssi-protocol) is a decentralized identity platform designed to provide secure and self-sovereign digital identities (DiD). To date, QuarkID has onboarded over 150,000 citizens in Latin America. By leveraging blockchain technology, QuarkID allows users to control their personal information, enhancing privacy and reducing dependence on centralized authorities. This approach is particularly impactful in regions where traditional identity systems are fragmented or inaccessible, offering reliable verification mechanisms and access to essential services.

### **3.2 AgriTech Initiatives in Africa**

Blockchain-based agricultural solutions are transforming the way farmers in Africa engage with markets and consumers. According to a [detailed analysis](https://www.eos-intelligence.com/perspectives/emerging-markets/agritech-in-africa-how-blockchain-can-help-revolutionize-agriculture/), these projects utilize smart contracts to ensure fair trade practices, providing timely and equitable payments to farmers. Blockchain technology also enhances supply chain transparency, tracking produce from farm to table to improve food safety and quality assurance. These innovations empower rural farmers by granting better market access, promoting fair pricing, and contributing to economic development in underserved communities.

### **3.3 Blockchain-Based Voting Systems in Southeast Asia**

Countries like Thailand and Indonesia are pioneering blockchain-based voting systems to improve transparency and trust in electoral processes. A [study on blockchain voting in Thailand](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341872623_The_Prototype_of_Thai_Blockchain-based_Voting_System) highlights how this technology creates an immutable and transparent ledger of votes, reducing fraud and increasing public confidence in elections. These systems demonstrate blockchain’s potential to enhance democratic institutions by offering a secure, transparent, and efficient means of conducting elections.

#### **3.4 Financial Tools for Low-Income Communities**

Blockchain’s use in financial tools has been especially transformative for low-income regions, where volatile national currencies and limited banking access pose challenges. Projects such as [Bitso](https://bitso.com/), [Bitsave](https://devpost.com/software/bitsave) and [Pinto](https://pintu.co.id/web3) leverage stablecoins to provide alternatives for saving and countering inflation. These platforms enable individuals to safeguard their wealth in regions where traditional banking systems are unstable or inaccessible. By providing access to secure financial instruments, these solutions address critical issues of economic inequality and financial inclusion.

### **3.5 EthicHub: Decentralized Agriculture Financing**

[EthicHub](https://www.ethichub.com/) connects small-scale farmers with global investors, using blockchain technology to offer decentralized financing solutions. Operating primarily in agricultural communities, this platform enables farmers to secure funding without the high-interest rates typically associated with traditional loans. Smart contracts facilitate transparent and efficient loan processing while ensuring fair repayment terms. EthicHub’s model demonstrates how decentralized finance (DeFi) can empower underserved communities and enhance global food security.

#### **3.6 Identity Integration with India Stack**

Projects like [Anon Aadhaar](https://pse.dev/en/projects/anon-aadhaar) integrate blockchain technology with India’s existing identity framework, [India Stack](https://www.indiastack.org/). These initiatives leverage decentralized identity systems to enable secure access to essential services while maintaining user privacy. By aligning blockchain solutions with national identity programs, such projects enhance inclusivity and ensure the protection of sensitive data for billions of users.

#### **Observations on Maturity and Scalability**

Up until a few years ago, many of these solutions could only exist on Ethereum due to its open, decentralized, and programmable infrastructure. Even then, the technology was not robust enough to support such use cases at scale. Today, however, blockchain technology has matured significantly, enabling scalable and impactful solutions that address pressing human challenges.

These projects underscore blockchain's potential not just as a financial tool but as a driver of social impact across various sectors, from identity management to agriculture and governance. Each initiative demonstrates how Ethereum and blockchain technology can empower underserved regions and create meaningful change at scale.


## **Section 4: State of Funding for Social Impact Projects**

The funding landscape for Web3 social impact projects continues to evolve, offering opportunities for builders and communities to address pressing human challenges. 

While there are multiple funding mechanisms available, challenges in accountability, verifiability, and equitable access remain significant barriers. Insights from the [2024 State of Web3 Grants Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JBbGos6Bjdvd1LRGDvIijREic4l7Th2I/view) highlight these issues, emphasizing the need for a systemic shift in how grants are awarded, measured, and reported.


### **4.1 Current Landscape**

Web3 funding ecosystems employ diverse mechanisms to support impact-driven projects. These include:

- **Proactive Grants**: Builders receive upfront funding to develop solutions that align with specific ecosystem priorities.  
  - Example: Gitcoin’s quadratic funding pools.
- **Retroactive Grants**: Programs like Optimism’s [RetroPGF](https://app.optimism.io/retroactive-public-goods-funding) *ideally* reward projects that demonstrate measurable success post-implementation.
- **Bounties and Incentives**: Protocols incentivize the development of targeted solutions, such as enhancing scalability or security.
- [**Quadratic Funding Pools**](https://qf.gitcoin.co/?grant=1&grant=2&grant=&grant=&grant=&match=100): Mechanisms like [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co), [Giveth](https://giveth.io/), and [Octant](https://octant.fund) allow communities to direct funds to projects that resonate with them, amplifying contributions through matching pools.

These mechanisms have catalyzed innovation across the ecosystem, yet systemic challenges persist.


### **4.2 Challenges in Social Impact Funding**

1. **Impact Verifiability**  
   Many grant programs conflate milestone completion with long-term impact. A lack of standardized frameworks for measuring outcomes leads to inconsistent or subjective reporting, making it difficult to assess the true value of funded projects.

2. **Fair Capital Distribution**  
   Grants often favor well-marketed initiatives or high-profile regions, leaving smaller, grassroots projects in underrepresented areas—such as Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia—without equitable access to resources.

3. **User Onboarding and Adoption**  
   Funding structures frequently neglect barriers to adoption, including language, digital literacy, and infrastructure limitations. Even well-funded projects risk limited impact if they fail to address these real-world constraints.

4. **Accountability and Reporting**  
   Grantees are often required to use multiple reporting tools, resulting in fragmented and inconsistent data collection. There is little incentive for grantees to provide regular updates, creating gaps in progress tracking and ecosystem-wide insights.


### **4.3 Ideal Funding Framework for Social Impact Projects**

To address these challenges, an ideal funding model for social impact projects should be grounded in the following principles:

1. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   - Establish standardized frameworks for tracking progress, including both quantitative and qualitative metrics.
   - Encourage systematic data collection to evaluate outcomes and ensure transparency throughout the grant lifecycle.
   - Foster decentralized reputation systems to measure credibility and long-term impact.

2. **Equitable Capital Allocation**  
   - Create region-specific funding pools to support underrepresented areas and projects addressing local challenges.
   - Prioritize funding for projects solving "human problems" with tangible societal benefits.

3. **Incentivized Engagement**  
   - Integrate reporting processes into project workflows, reducing friction for grantees.
   - Provide tokenized rewards or reputational benefits for consistent updates and participation.

4. **Flexibility and Long-Term Vision**  
   - Balance proactive funding with retroactive rewards to incentivize both innovation and proven results.
   - Support experimental and iterative approaches that align with long-term goals, even if they lack immediate financial ROI.


#### **4.4 Bridging the Gap**

Addressing these systemic issues requires collective action from grant providers, developers, and community members. By prioritizing equitable access, robust measurement systems, and incentivized accountability, the Ethereum ecosystem can create a funding environment that fosters meaningful, scalable social impact.

Long-term principles act as a **compass**, informing the creation of short-term goals and ensuring that incremental progress aligns with the broader vision. Examples include:

- **Taglines**: A concise narrative that encapsulates the project’s ethos.  
  - *Example*: “Empowering individuals to own their privacy.”
  
- **Narratives**: A story or framing that consistently guides decision-making.  

## **Section 5: Embedding Impact Systems into Ethereum dApps**

### **5.1 Understanding the Logical Chain**

To effectively embed impact into Ethereum-based projects, it’s crucial to establish a framework that balances **short-term measurable goals** with **long-term guiding principles**. These two elements are complementary: the former provides actionable benchmarks for progress, while the latter ensures a consistent, overarching vision that informs all decisions.

#### **Short-Term Goals with Theories of Change**

Short-term goals serve as immediate milestones, often aligned with a project's **theory of change**. They involve clear questions or hypotheses that link **activities** to **outcomes**, helping measure incremental progress.

For example:

- **Privacy Education Initiative**:  
  - *Short-Term Goal*: Increase workshop attendance by 25% within three months.  
  - *Theory of Change*: If individuals participate in privacy workshops, their understanding of online safety practices will improve, leading to increased adoption of privacy tools.  

Short-term goals like these are vital for tracking actionable outputs and outcomes, ensuring the project remains adaptable and responsive to immediate needs.

#### **Long-Term Guiding Principles**

While short-term goals measure progress, long-term guiding principles provide a project with **directional coherence**. These principles are not fixed objectives or mission statements that must be “achieved,” but rather enduring values or narratives that shape a project’s evolution over time. 
  - *Example*: “Privacy is a human right, and everyone should have tools to protect it.”  


#### **The Interplay Between Short-Term Goals and Long-Term Principles**

In practice, these two elements interact dynamically:

1. **Short-Term Goals as Measurable Steps**  
   Projects should ask:  
   - *What are we trying to achieve in the next six months or year?*  
   - *How do these goals align with our long-term principle?*  
   Example: A privacy education initiative sets a goal to train 1,000 participants in privacy practices. This measurable output connects to the broader principle of ensuring accessible privacy education for all.

2. **Long-Term Principles as Contextual Anchors**  
   These principles ensure that even as short-term goals evolve, they remain consistent with the project’s purpose. They also provide a foundation for communication, storytelling, and stakeholder engagement.  
   Example: While training programs evolve to include new technologies, the principle—*empowering individuals to control their digital identity*—remains unchanged.

3. **Guided Experimentation**  
   Having both elements allows projects to experiment and adapt without losing focus. Short-term outcomes provide actionable insights, while long-term principles serve as a reference point for navigating uncertainty.  


#### **Another Practical Application**

Let’s revisit the privacy education example:

- **Activities**: Launch workshops focused on privacy tools.
- **Outputs**: Number of participants trained.
- **Outcomes**: Increased adoption of privacy tools among participants.
- **Impact**: A long-term shift in community behavior toward safer online practices.

The **long-term principle** here could be framed as:  
*"Building a world where privacy is accessible and actionable for everyone."*

Every short-term goal and activity would then feed into this principle, ensuring coherence while allowing flexibility in execution.


### **5.2 Embedding the Activities → Outputs → Outcomes → Impact Progression**

To embed meaningful change into Ethereum-based projects, it’s essential to map a clear progression:

![Key-project-elements-inputs-activities-outputs-and-outcomes-and-suitable-monitoring](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkZxmOdXJl.png)


- **Activities → Outputs → Outcomes → Impact**

This framework establishes a direct connection between the specific actions a project undertakes and the tangible or intangible changes it produces, ensuring systematic progress tracking.

#### **The Framework:**

1. **Activities**: The actions a project undertakes to address a specific challenge.  
   - *Example*: Conducting workshops on privacy practices using a blockchain-based education platform.
  
2. **Outputs**: The measurable, immediate results of those activities.  
   - *Example*: Number of workshops conducted and participants trained.
  
3. **Outcomes**: The intermediate effects of outputs on participants, communities, or systems.  
   - *Example*: Increased adoption of privacy-enhancing tools by workshop attendees.
  
4. **Impact**: The long-term, systemic change resulting from the outcomes.  
   - *Example*: Enhanced digital security and reduced exposure to online risks within underserved communities.

#### **Ethereum’s Role in the Logical Chain**  
Ethereum’s transparency and programmability enable projects to track and verify each step in this progression. For example:

- **On-Chain Activity Tracking**: Use smart contracts to document activities like attendance in workshops or completion of milestones.
- **Output Verification**: Immutable records on the blockchain can verify outputs such as the number of NFTs issued as workshop participation certificates.
- **Outcome Evaluation**: Combine on-chain metrics with off-chain feedback (e.g., survey results) to assess behavioral changes.
- **Impact Analysis**: Leverage the blockchain to archive long-term data, ensuring accountability and enabling retrospective evaluations of progress.

By aligning short-term outputs with overarching impact principles, projects can navigate the balance between immediate goals and long-term vision.


### **5.3 Stakeholder Engagement for Sustainable Impact**

Stakeholder engagement ensures that impact initiatives remain relevant, inclusive, and grounded in the needs of the communities they aim to serve. Ethereum’s decentralized tools offer innovative approaches to stakeholder participation:

1. **Transparent Decision-Making**:  
   Governance tokens empower stakeholders to influence critical decisions, fostering inclusivity and accountability.  
   - *Example*: A DAO issues governance tokens allowing community members to vote on resource allocation or project priorities.

2. **Feedback Loops**:  
   Smart contracts enable real-time responses to stakeholder inputs, ensuring iterative and adaptive development.  
   - *Example*: Stakeholders earn reputation tokens for submitting feedback, increasing their influence on future decisions.


### **5.4 Designing Data-Driven Methodologies for Impact Tracking**

Effective impact tracking involves integrating both on-chain and off-chain tools to collect and analyze data systematically. Key components include:

1. **Comprehensive Data Collection**:  
   Use blockchain tools (e.g., smart contracts, NFTs) and traditional methods (e.g., surveys) to capture a holistic picture of progress.  
   - *Example*: A privacy education project issues NFTs for workshop attendance while collecting post-event feedback through decentralized applications.

2. **SMART Goals**:  
   Clearly defined goals guide progress tracking:  
   - **Specific**: Define objectives like “Train 1,000 participants on privacy tools within six months.”  
   - **Measurable**: Use metrics such as attendance rates, quiz scores, or tool adoption statistics.  
   - **Achievable**: Ensure goals align with the project’s capacity.  
   - **Relevant**: Align goals with broader social impact principles.  
   - **Time-Bound**: Set deadlines to evaluate progress.

3. **Iterative Feedback Mechanisms**:  
   Regularly review progress with stakeholders and adapt methodologies based on collected data, ensuring relevance and improvement.


### **5.5 Leveraging Ethereum’s Strengths for Impact Mapping**

Ethereum excels as a platform for embedding change due to its unique characteristics, making it a cornerstone for designing scalable and transparent systems to measure, incentivize, and sustain impact.


#### **Core Strengths**

1. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   Blockchains serve as a **history technology**, creating immutable records of actions and outcomes. This ensures historical data is preserved, enabling stakeholders to verify progress in real time.  

   - **Use Case**: Sustainability milestones stored on-chain allow communities or funders to track the success of eco-tourism projects, fostering trust through visible progress.  
   - **Innovative Application**: Using tokens to map the distribution of resources or highlight eco-tourism locations, embedding vital contextual information about these areas directly on-chain.

2. **Programmability**  
   Ethereum’s smart contracts offer unparalleled flexibility to design programmable systems of value, exchange, and accountability.  

   - **Use Case**: Dynamic funding mechanisms that release resources only when specified conditions are met, or reputation systems where tokens gain or decay value based on active participation.  
   - **Innovative Application**: Tokens designed for governance models with escalating voting power for consistent contributors, ensuring active engagement in long-term projects.

3. **Interoperability**  
   Ethereum supports integrations with other decentralized applications and off-chain systems, enabling efficient scaling and adaptability.  

   - **Use Case**: Projects using [decentralized exchanges (DEXs)](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-decentralized-exchange-dex) to provide liquidity for community tokens or integrating with oracles to verify real-world data, such as environmental changes or attendance records.  
   - **Innovative Application**: Leveraging interoperable tools to create decentralized knowledge graphs, preserving rural practices or local traditions for broader educational or economic benefits.

4. **Inclusivity and Accessibility**  
   Ethereum’s open architecture ensures anyone with internet access can participate, enabling underserved communities to contribute to and benefit from impact initiatives.  

   - **Use Case**: Decentralized identity solutions enabling marginalized communities to verify their identity securely and access essential services.  
   - **Innovative Application**: Building ecosystem tokens that incentivize sustainable behaviors, creating circular economies within local regions while empowering participants to become active stakeholders.



#### **Expanding Ethereum’s Use Cases**

Beyond these strengths, Ethereum fosters creative applications that redefine how impact can be achieved and measured:

- **Collaborative Knowledge Graphs**  
  Blockchain enables decentralized, immutable databases where communities contribute, verify, and preserve shared knowledge. These systems can enhance transparency in areas like conservation, scientific research, and cultural preservation.  
- **Ecosystem Currencies for Circular Economies**  
  Local communities can utilize blockchain-based tokens to incentivize and reward sustainable practices, ensuring economic value stays within the community while promoting environmental stewardship.  



### **5.7 Bridging the Gap Between Data and Impact**

While data provides the foundation for measuring progress, the human element is what drives meaningful impact. Projects must focus on:

- **Contextual Relevance**: Tailor data collection to reflect the specific challenges and goals of each project.  
- **Narrative-Driven Metrics**: Combine numbers with stories to humanize progress and inspire action.  
- **Responsible Experimentation**: Acknowledge that iterative adjustments are part of the impact process and refine methodologies accordingly.

### **5.8 Establishing Fit-for-Purpose IMM Systems**

When it comes to impact measurement, the core principle is simple: **track the theories of change relative to your actions.** This means identifying the chain of activities, outputs, outcomes, and impacts, and ensuring that your data reflects these connections.

It’s important to recognize that the **level of precision required** for data collection is relative. At its core, what matters most is **having data**—data that can tell a story, even if it’s crude, imperfect, or captured with basic tools.

Your theory of change (ToC) should guide the way you collect your data, combining numerical outputs with the narrative context of the project.

What we aim for is the ability to:

- **Compare data points over time.**
- **Measure percentage changes or material shifts across periods or initiatives.**
- **Determine the direction and magnitude of change relative to project goals.**

**This doesn’t require a multi-million-dollar system or tools.** There has been a lot of needless spending in the past, most likely because individuals unfamiliar with specific fields were tasked with designing data systems. This inefficiency is part of the nascence and experimentation that early ecosystems experience.

What it requires is a clear outline of:

1. **Goals**: What are you trying to achieve?
2. **Stakeholders**: Who is affected, involved, or impacted?
3. **Basic Data**: Data that reflects outputs, whether positive or negative, and whether it’s granular or aggregated.

At the end of the day, the data should serve as a testament to your project’s progress—**a record of change**. Whether that change is large or small, intentional or unexpected, the act of documenting it forms the foundation of an impact measurement system.

This is something I learned from a mentor of mine *(thank you Elizabeth)* after overcomplicating processes in an effort to account for every edge case imaginable.

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) **unless it is entirely objectively necessary.**



#### **Steps to Build IMM Systems for dApps**

1. **Define Impact Goals**: Start with a clear understanding of the social, environmental, or economic change you aim to achieve.
   - **Example**: Organization Y sets a goal of reducing community waste by 20% within three years.
2. **Identify Metrics**: Focus on measurable indicators that are directly tied to your actions.
   - **Example**: Number of households participating in recycling programs or total weight of recycled materials collected.
3. **Leverage Blockchain Tools**: Use Ethereum's capabilities to store data immutably, automate data collection via smart contracts, and validate results through oracles.
   - **Example**: Organization Y records recycling metrics on-chain for public accountability.
4. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Regularly review data with stakeholders to refine goals and approaches, ensuring the IMM system evolves alongside the project.

#### Utilizing Smart Contracts Example

Let’s consider an example with **Organization X**, which runs privacy education programs. They aim to measure:

1. **Participation**: Number of attendees in workshops over a given period.
2. **Outcomes**: Percentage increase in participants' understanding of privacy practices.
3. **Impact**: Behavioral changes, such as adopting privacy tools, over time.

Using a smart contract-based IMM system:

- **Tokenization**: Organization X issues NFTs to workshop participants to represent their involvement.
- **Data Input**: Retroactively appends data such as participation stats, quiz scores, or feedback linked to ERC-721 tokens.
- **Epoch Marking**: Divides data into relative periods (e.g., months, quarters) for analysis and tracking.

Here’s a high-level solidity pseudo code example of how such a smart contract could function:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/**
 * @title ImpactMeasurement
 * @dev A customizable and forkable contract for archiving and visualizing impact data
 */
contract ImpactMeasurement {
    struct ImpactData {
        uint256 period; // Epoch or relative period for data tracking
        string metadata; // Description of the data collected
        uint256 value; // Numerical representation of the impact (e.g., % improvement)
    }

    mapping(uint256 => ImpactData) public impactRecords; // Map impact records by ID
    uint256 public nextRecordId;

    address public admin; // Contract owner/admin

    event DataArchived(uint256 recordId, uint256 period, string metadata, uint256 value);

    modifier onlyAdmin() {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can perform this action");
        _;
    }

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender; // Set contract deployer as admin
    }

    /**
     * @dev Archive impact data for a specific period
     * @param _period The period/epoch for the data
     * @param _metadata A short description of the data
     * @param _value The numerical representation of impact
     */
    function archiveData(uint256 _period, string memory _metadata, uint256 _value) public onlyAdmin {
        require(_value >= 0, "Value must be non-negative");

        ImpactData memory newData = ImpactData({
            period: _period,
            metadata: _metadata,
            value: _value
        });

        impactRecords[nextRecordId] = newData;
        emit DataArchived(nextRecordId, _period, _metadata, _value);
        nextRecordId++;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Retrieve all impact data by period
     * @param _period The period to filter by
     */
    function getImpactDataByPeriod(uint256 _period) public view returns (ImpactData[] memory) {
        uint256 count = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < nextRecordId; i++) {
            if (impactRecords[i].period == _period) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        ImpactData[] memory results = new ImpactData[](count);
        uint256 index = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < nextRecordId; i++) {
            if (impactRecords[i].period == _period) {
                results[index] = impactRecords[i];
                index++;
            }
        }
        return results;
    }
}
```





## Section 6: A Broader Light Framework for Social Good in The Ethereum Ecosystem


### **6.1 A Vision for a Modular Impact Suite**

Beyond smart contracts, the framework envisions a **suite of tools** designed to address the multifaceted needs of impact mapping and measurement. These tools would not only simplify data collection and verification but also foster collaboration across projects, grant programs, and stakeholders. 

This ecosystem would enable the creation of **impact certificates** tied to milestones and provide mechanisms for data-driven quantification, addressing the limitations of tools like [Hypercerts](https://hypercerts.xyz/) by ensuring verifiability, contextual relevance, and forward-planning capabilities, while mitigating their overemphasis on retroactive attribution and fragmentation risks.

This is **not a solution to perfect data** but rather a **distribution** or **archival method**. By ensuring that data—however crude—can be standardized, visualized, and archived, this system would create a unique reporting mechanism native to Web3.


#### **Key Components of the Impact Suite**

1. **Smart Contract Templates**  
   - **Pre-Built Modules**: Smart contracts for common use cases, such as milestone validation, tokenization of outcomes, and dynamic funding.  
   - **Customizable Features**: Projects can modify templates to suit specific needs while ensuring interoperability.

2. **Open-Source Integrations**  
   - **Survey Tools**: Integrate platforms like [KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/), [SurveyCTO](https://www.surveycto.com/) or [ODK (Open Data Kit)](https://getodk.org/) for collecting qualitative and quantitative data directly from stakeholders.  
   - **Real-Time Syncing**: Enable seamless syncing of data collected through decentralized oracles to ensure continuous updates across systems.

3. **Grant Program Integration**  
   - **Cross-Pollination of Data**: Grant programs can share information, track milestones, and synchronize impact metrics across projects.  
   - **Attestation and Fundraising**: Use Ethereum’s transparency to verify funds raised, allocated, and spent, ensuring accountability.

4. **Impact Certificates**  
   - **Milestone-Based Certificates**: generate certificates when specific milestones are achieved, serving as immutable proof of progress.  
   - **Quantification Mechanisms**: Integrate on-chain and off-chain data streams to quantify milestones (e.g., attendance, CO2 reduction, literacy rates).  
   - **Multi-Dimensional Tracking**: Link certificates to broader goals, such as SDGs or theories of change, providing context and relatability.


#### **6.2 Expanding Verifiability**

Verifiability goes beyond proving data authenticity—it involves contextualizing data to ensure it reflects the goals, processes, and outcomes of the project. This suite enables enhanced verification through:

1. **Unified Attestation Models**  
   - Enable community members, validators, or grant administrators to attest to milestones via governance tokens or reputation systems.

2. **Data Integrity Tools**  
   - Link off-chain data (e.g., survey results, IoT sensor outputs) with on-chain attestations to create a comprehensive audit trail.

3. **Cross-Program Certification**  
   - Develop standards for grant programs to issue unified certifications, enhancing interoperability and reducing fragmentation in impact reporting.



#### **6.3 Integration with Grant Programs**

Grant programs can leverage this suite to:

1. **Track and Verify Milestones**  
   - Automate milestone validation through smart contracts and decentralized oracles, reducing administrative overhead.

2. **Measure Grant Effectiveness**  
   - Use impact certificates to compare progress across grantees, creating an objective basis for evaluating program success.

3. **Foster Collaboration**  
   - Cross-sync data across different grant programs, enabling projects to share insights, collaborate on overlapping goals, and scale impact.

#### **6.4 Building a Collaborative Ecosystem**

This suite doesn’t just facilitate measurement; it fosters **collaboration** across stakeholders by:

1. **Shared Data Pools**  
   - Enable projects to contribute to and access shared datasets, such as community-verified knowledge graphs or regional milestone repositories.

2. **Unified Reporting Standards**  
   - Develop open standards for impact reporting, ensuring consistency and comparability across projects and grant programs.

3. **Ecosystem Tokens for Collaboration**  
   - Issue governance or reputation tokens that incentivize cross-project participation, such as sharing data or providing feedback on impact milestones.


#### **A Closing Thought**

The **Impact Suite** is a high level and *idealistic* reimagination for how Ethereum can support impact-driven initiatives by integrating modular tools, grant synchronization, and milestone-based certification. It functions as a future-forward initiative that will evolve based on real-world experimentation.

By creating a collaborative ecosystem that quantifies, verifies, and connects impact data, this approach bridges the gap between technology and tangible outcomes, ensuring projects can scale sustainably while maintaining accountability.


## **Section 7: Framing Social Impact as Experiments with Long-Term Vision**

Social impact projects often defy conventional metrics like profit margins or immediate ROI. Their success is rarely about financial returns but rather about *relative* meaningful, incremental change over time. And I believe this is a crucial distinction that not only needs to be understood but factored into decision making for;  both the people running these projects and the external organizations supporting them within the ecosystem.

For example, a project aiming to improve privacy education might measure success not by revenue but by the percentage increase in people adopting safer online practices year over year.

This inherently makes social impact projects harder to quantify, especially when compared to traditional startups or profit-driven protocols.

To address this challenge, funding for social good projects needs to shift from expecting guaranteed results to embracing **experiments**. 

Viewing these initiatives as experimental endeavors allows us to prioritize learning, iteration, and adaptation. Funding shouldn’t just reward results but also the *process—the efforts* to explore solutions to human problems, even when outcomes are uncertain or imperfect.

This experimental approach requires **more than just financial resources**; it demands a collective willingness to care about and invest in the outcomes of these efforts. A notable example of this mindset in action is the [Octant Accelerator](https://blog.octant.build/apply-to-the-octant-x-gitcoin-round/). It was an experiment. It exemplified deliberate effort and execution aimed at addressing these critical points, showcasing how thoughtful initiatives can prioritize learning, iteration, and meaningful impact.

Social impact work inherently involves stakeholders who face the problems in real life, and the Ethereum ecosystem is uniquely suited to support such initiatives. With its decentralized ethos, transparency, and focus on commons/public goods, Ethereum provides the ideal environment for nurturing these *“experiments”* in creating human-centric solutions.

#### A Shift Toward Long Term Thinking

Post-Devcon7 discussions underscored the need for the Ethereum community to adopt **long-term thinking** when addressing social impact. If we are to make meaningful change—both to the protocol itself and to the people who interact with it—we must deliberately shift our perspective from short-term results to sustained impact. This requires investing in projects that envision longevity, offering the time, space, and tools to iterate toward scalable solutions.

#### Proactive Experimentation

By taking deliberate steps to frame funding as **proactive experiments**, the Ethereum ecosystem can position itself as the ideal platform for impact-driven innovation. This means fostering a culture that values:

- **Incremental progress**: For example, achieving a 10% improvement in literacy rates over two years.  
- **Resilience and iteration**: Allowing projects the flexibility to grow and adapt over time.  
- **A long-term community perspective**: Understanding the value of investing in solutions that may not provide immediate returns but lay the foundation for generational change.  

The challenges we aim to address are inherently large in scope, demanding careful and thoughtful planning and execution. This approach must include:  

a) **Attempting to solve a problem**: Taking concrete steps to address specific issues.  
b) **Providing alternative solutions**: Offering multiple pathways or methods to approach challenges.  
c) **Discovering new information and contexts**: Gaining deeper insights into problems by exploring them comprehensively.  
d) **Experimenting to find what doesn’t work**: Embracing failure as part of the learning process to refine future efforts.  

Each of these approaches is meaningful in tackling complex problems. Expecting perfect solutions from the start is not only unrealistic but **counterproductive**—it undermines the iterative nature of progress and the value of learning from trial and error.

This deliberate approach mirrors Ethereum's own development journey: evolving over years, building infrastructure patiently, and solving protocol-level challenges one step at a time. Just as Ethereum's progress has required foresight and resilience, so too must our efforts to fund and measure social impact projects.

By adopting this mindset, Ethereum can set a powerful example—not only as a technological leader but also as a **human-centered ecosystem** that prioritizes deliberate, long-term, and impactful change. This perspective is essential, particularly in the context of what we are building: financial systems, reputation systems, and public goods.  

While this approach may seem idealistic—especially given the reality that grant bodies often expect tangible returns—there is a critical need for deliberate action. Those who *can* adopt and advocate for this approach **should do so**, as it will ultimately guide the ecosystem toward meaningful and sustained progress.



## **Section 8: Call to Action**

As Ethereum evolves, so does its potential to redefine how we think about and act on social impact. The conversations at Devcon7 emphasized a critical realization: building meaningful change requires not just technological innovation but deliberate, long-term commitment. This is a call to action for the Ethereum community to rally around these principles.

#### **8.1 Standardizing Impact Reporting and Archiving**

Impact measurement today is often inconsistent, siloed, and difficult to communicate. To address this:

- **Open Protocols for Impact Reporting**: The Ethereum ecosystem can lead by developing open-source tools that projects can fork, customize, and use to track and archive impact data transparently.
- **Cross-Project Comparisons**: Standardized formats for reporting impact make it easier to compare progress across initiatives, fostering collaboration rather than competition.
- **Integrating with Funding Mechanisms**: By aligning reporting protocols with grant programs, funders can evaluate projects based on measurable progress and real-world outcomes.

This standardization benefits not just projects but the entire ecosystem, as it elevates Ethereum's reputation as a platform capable of solving human-centric problems.



### **8.2 Proactive, Experiment-Driven Funding**

Social impact initiatives require resources and patience to succeed. Unlike traditional startups, these projects define success through incremental change—measuring progress in **percentages over time** rather than financial ROI. The Ethereum community must embrace this unique challenge by:

- **Framing Funding as Experiments**: Grants should prioritize exploration and iteration, understanding that not all projects will yield immediate, tangible results.
- **Supporting Long-Term Visions**: Funding mechanisms need to shift focus from short-term deliverables to initiatives that aim to create sustained, meaningful impact.
- **Collaborative Investment**: Funders, DAOs, and projects should work together to pool resources, sharing risks and rewards to support impactful experiments.

By framing funding as a long-term investment in experimentation, Ethereum can unlock new groundbreaking solutions that would otherwise go unfunded or worse *unrealized*.


### **8.3 Fostering Global Collaboration**

Devcon7 highlighted the richness of regional perspectives, from Africa to Latin America to Southeast Asia. These regions bring unique challenges, solutions, and opportunities for collaboration. The Ethereum ecosystem should:

- **Amplify Underrepresented Voices**: Ensure projects from diverse regions receive equitable funding and visibility.
- **Facilitate Cross-Regional Synergies**: Create platforms for projects from different regions to share knowledge, resources, and tools.
- **Celebrate Localized Impact**: Recognize that impact does not have to be global to be meaningful—what matters is the tangible change within a community.

Global collaboration strengthens Ethereum's position as a decentralized, inclusive ecosystem capable of tackling challenges across varied contexts.



### **8.4 Building for Longevity**

The ethos of Ethereum has always been to think long-term. Whether it’s the phased rollout of Ethereum 2.0 or the evolution of its developer community, deliberate action has been key to its success. Social impact projects must adopt the same mindset:

- **Deliberate Action**: Focus on quality over quantity, building solutions that are sustainable and scalable.
- **Generational Thinking**: Impact projects should aim to create lasting change that extends beyond the immediate future.
- **Commitment to Iteration**: Just as Ethereum evolves through community input and experimentation, social impact initiatives should grow through iterative learning.



#### **A Shared Responsibility**

This call to action is not just for developers or funders—it’s for the entire Ethereum community. Together, we can build tools, frameworks, and systems that empower projects to measure, report, and amplify their impact. By embracing collaboration, experimentation, and longevity, we ensure that Ethereum remains not just a platform for innovation but a force for good in the world.

## **Section 9: Conclusion**

Blockchain technology, at its core, is about more than just decentralization and transparency—it is a medium for creating systems that endure. Ethereum, as a platform, exemplifies this through its programmability and its capacity to adapt to the evolving needs of its community. However, its most profound potential lies in its ability to enable real-world, human-centric solutions.

This artifact has explored how Ethereum can become a cornerstone for impact measurement, reporting, and archiving. By adopting open protocols, fostering experimentation, and prioritizing long-term thinking, the ecosystem can bridge the gap between technological innovation and meaningful societal change.

#### **Key Takeaways**

- **A New Standard for Impact**: Ethereum offers a foundation to build systems that transparently measure and archive progress, ensuring accountability and trust.
- **Empowering Global Communities**: The platform's decentralized nature enables it to support diverse regions and amplify voices that are often underrepresented.
- **A Commitment to Longevity**: Just as Ethereum has matured through deliberate, iterative progress, so too must the social impact projects it enables. Success lies in fostering generational change that benefits not just today’s users but future communities.

#### **Final Reflections**
Whether applied to [preserving cultural heritage](https://summitshare.co), empowering local economies, or addressing human challenges, Ethereum’s potential to transform how we measure and enact change is unparalleled.

The reality of a global, interconnected network is that it brings with it an inevitable share of noise and distractions. People are empowered to create, define, and transact value in ways never before possible—sometimes leading to chaos or frivolity. Yet, this should never overshadow the remarkable advancements being made across infrastructure, protocols, and applications.

As a community, we must embrace the challenges of experimentation and the uncertainties inherent in impact work. We must think long-term, investing not just in technology but in people, communities, and ideas. This is how we move toward a future where blockchain becomes a synonym for trust, progress, and collaboration.

This is the ethos of Ethereum: not merely a tool for developers or protocols, but an enabler for humanity to confront its most urgent challenges. Let’s build not just for the protocol but for the people who use it—and for the world we aspire to create.

It’s time for all of us to ground ourselves in reality—to *touch grass*, to listen, and to understand what’s truly happening on the ground. We may not find the ultimate solution or the perfect answer that satisfies every ideal or mental box. But there are enough sparks of potential, enough areas of *hope*, to nurture into beautiful and ever-expanding solutions that solve real problems and bring people together.
